    <h1>Hello!! My name is Desiree Guerrero. </h1>
    <p> I love to go shopping. I am the student representative of my school SLT and part of the group of peer coaches of the MAAL Community, which is a club that helps students who struggle academically. I serve as interpreter during conferences. I am a rising junior. I also like to spend quality time with my family and friends. I enjoy reading and watching tv. A fun fact about me is that I have never watched a single movie of the Marvel films sequel. I like to try new things and I always seek to be the best version of myself.</p>
